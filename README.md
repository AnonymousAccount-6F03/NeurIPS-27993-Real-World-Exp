# Real-World Exprements for NeurIPS-Submission-27993

We validated the navigation capabilities of the proposed method in indoor environments, including laboratory, corridor and semi-outdoor settings. Our approach demonstrated the ability to autonomously explore, avoid obstacles, and navigate toward targets, exhibiting promising sim-to-real generalization capabilities.
